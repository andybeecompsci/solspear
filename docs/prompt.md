# SolSpear Project Update

## Overview
You are tasked with updating the SolSpear project to incorporate the new wallet tracking functionality outlined in the provided documentation. Here’s what you need to do:

### Steps:
1. **Read and Analyze:**
   - Current Project Files: Understand the existing implementation of the project.
   - Previous Outline: Review the initial project scope and implementation details to grasp the current state.
   - New Outline: Carefully read the updated plan for integrating Solana WebSocket-based wallet tracking.

2. **Confirm and Clarify:**
   - Identify any missing information required to begin implementation.
   - Note any unclear aspects or dependencies that need resolution.
   - Confirm readiness to proceed before making significant changes.

3. **Begin Development:**
   - Use the `test_bot.py` file to start implementing the new functionality as described in the updated plan.
   - Focus on **real-time wallet tracking** via Solana’s WebSocket API.
   - Ensure any changes made align with the project’s architecture and goals.

4. **Communication:**
   - Proactively identify and document assumptions or dependencies in the code.
   - Highlight blockers directly in the code or as comments for review.

## Action Items for Development
### Tasks:
1. Integrate Solana WebSocket functionality for tracking wallets.
2. Modify the `/track` command to establish WebSocket subscriptions.
3. Update the database schema to include WebSocket subscription status.
4. Implement basic notifications for wallet activity.
5. Include error handling for rate limits and WebSocket reconnections.
6. Test the implemented functionality against edge cases and expected usage.

## Output Expectations
- Begin work on `test_bot.py` after analyzing all relevant materials.
- Maintain modular and clean code to ensure future scalability.
- Use comments to highlight any blockers or areas requiring clarification.

This should ensure a smooth transition from the old implementation to the new WebSocket-based functionality. Proceed with implementation and document progress directly in the code.
